# Backbone Chat.

A simple chat application built using backbone.js. The structure of components is lifted entirely from Addy Osmani's terrific book [Developing Backbone.js](http://addyosmani.github.io/backbone-fundamentals/) Applications.

I used [moment.js](http://momentjs.com/) for the time formatting, and [Backbone.localStorage](https://github.com/jeromegn/Backbone.localStorage) to persist the chats.
